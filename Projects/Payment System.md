# <center> Payment System

In the Payment System, there are some service providers and customers who can buy their services and manage all the details.
This is a Payment System application built using the Spring Boot framework, MySQL for database management, JSP for server-side rendering of HTML templates, and Bootstrap for styling. The project includes session tracking for secure logins and usage.
## Project Flow
### Home (Register and Login)
**Home Page :** When you start the spring boot application you will see the homepage of Payment System. On the home page, there are 2 options `Register` for new user registration and `Login` for existing users.

**Login Page :** When you click on Login, it will show the **Login (Customer & Biller)** form. In the navigation bar, you have two options: `Register as Biller` for biller registration and `Register as Customer` for customer registration.

### Customer Functionalities
**Customer Dashboard :** In the customer dashboard there are 3 components.
1. One is the nav-bar, which displays the registered customer's name and a Logout option to log out the current user and redirect to the home page.
2. Another is the sidebar, where we have all the options like View Profile, My Orders, All Billers, All Products, and Registered Billers.
3. The third is the content area, which displays all the available products on the platform by different billers. Each product shows the product details (name, description, category, and seller) and the price of the product, along with a Buy Now button to purchase that product. If you click on Buy Now, an order will be placed for that product, and you will be redirected to the My Orders section.
